# Problem

Consider these two pieces of text “Edinburgh is a beautiful city” and “愛丁堡是個很漂亮的城市”. Very quickly we can notice that the Chinese text is not separated by spaces as the English is. So how do you extract terms for your analytics?
In this work I have used jieba library of python to segment chinese text and created a Bag of words model.
